          "question": "In a closed-loop control system, what is the role of the feedback signal?",
          "answer": "The feedback signal is used to adjust the control input to achieve the desired output."

          "question": "What is the transfer function of a control system?",
          "answer": "The transfer function is a mathematical representation that defines the output response of a system to an input signal in the Laplace transform domain."

          "question": "What is the purpose of a Bode plot in control system analysis?",
          "answer": "A Bode plot is used to analyze the frequency response of a control system and assess its stability and performance."
