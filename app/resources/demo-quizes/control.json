            "question": "What is the primary difference between open-loop and closed-loop control systems?",
            "answer": "Closed-loop control systems use feedback to compare the actual output with the desired output, while open-loop systems do not."
          },
          {
            "question": "In a closed-loop control system, what is the role of the feedback signal?",
            "answer": "The feedback signal is used to adjust the control input to achieve the desired output."

          {
            "question": "Which of the following is an advantage of closed-loop control systems?",
            "answer": "Increased accuracy and ability to correct disturbances and changes in system parameters."

            "question": "What is the transfer function of a control system?",
            "answer": "The transfer function is a mathematical representation that defines the output response of a system to an input signal in the Laplace transform domain."
          },
          {
            "question": "Why is stability important in control systems?",
            "answer": "Stability ensures that the system will return to its equilibrium state after a disturbance."
          },
          {
            "question": "What is the purpose of a Bode plot in control system analysis?",
            "answer": "A Bode plot is used to analyze the frequency response of a control system and assess its stability and performance."

          {
            "question": "Define the term 'Gain Margin' in the context of control systems.",

          {
            "question": "What is the Nyquist criterion used for?",
            "answer": "The Nyquist criterion is used to determine the stability of a control system by analyzing the frequency response plot."

            "question": "How can PID controllers be used in closed-loop control systems?",
            "answer": "PID controllers adjust the control input based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms of the error signal to achieve desired system performance."

          {
            "question": "Explain the concept of feedforward control and how it complements feedback control.",
            "answer": "Feedforward control predicts the effect of disturbances and adjusts the control input accordingly, while feedback control corrects errors based on the actual output."
          },
          {
            "question": "Give an example of a real-world application of a closed-loop control system.",
